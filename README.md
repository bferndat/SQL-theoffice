# SQL-theoffice
SQL queries on fictional "The Office" dataset

In this mini project, I followed along with a SQL tutorial video on Youtube from freecodecamp

I treated each question tutorial as an assignment, altering some queries to manipulate data that I myself wanted to find.

This is basically just a presentation of my SQL skills and how I might apply them on a real world case.

The lines that "create" the tables are fully copied.  However, the queries afterwards are my own, checked with the instructors codes.
